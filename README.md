# Tutorials

Tutorials and Practical sessions created and organized by the team. This is not DS4A material.

@andres0sorio set up some material for the team. We had a practical session outside of DS4A, to learn about github and discuss about how to develop our Final Project backend. We reviewed its architecture and some key aspects.
